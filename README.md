Test Scenario:
- Test Scenario is a high-level description of a specific functionality or feature to be tested.
- It helps in identifying what needs to be tested and provides a broad overview of the test scope.
Test Case:
- Test Case is a detailed set of conditions, steps, and expected results that define how a specific functionality or feature should be tested.
- Each Test Case should have a unique identifier, such as TC-1, TC-2, TC-3, etc.
- Test Steps provide a detailed list of the steps to be followed to execute the test case.
- Input represents the input data or actions required for each step.
- Expected Results define the expected outcome or behavior for each step in the test case.
- Actual Results capture the actual outcome or behavior observed during test execution.
- Pass/Fail indicates whether the test case passed or failed based on the comparison of expected and actual results.
- Test Case Complexity represents the complexity level of the test case, which can be categorized as low, medium, or high.
- Test Case Severity indicates the impact of a test case failure on the system, which can be categorized as low, medium, or high.

Test Strategy and Plan:
- Test Strategy is a document that outlines the overall approach to testing for a project or release.
- It defines the testing objectives, scope, test levels, test types, entry and exit criteria, test environment, and resource allocation.
  
- Test Plan is a document that describes the detailed approach and activities planned for testing.
- It includes information about test objectives, test scope, test deliverables, test schedule, test estimation, test environment, and test resources.
- Test Strategy and Plan provide guidelines and direction for the testing team, ensuring a structured and organized approach to testing.

Test Summary Report:
- Test Summary Report is a document that provides an overview of the testing activities and their outcomes.
- It includes the test execution status, test coverage, defects found, and overall assessment of the product quality.
- The report summarizes the testing efforts and outcomes, highlighting any significant findings or issues encountered during testing.
- It may also include recommendations for future testing improvements based on lessons learned during the testing process.
- The Test Summary Report helps stakeholders understand the current state of testing and make informed decisions regarding the product release.
